# networkgallery

A photo gallery template for displaying images with 16x9 aspect ratio.  Photos have associations with neighbouring photos along several dimensions, such as date, average colour in the image and location (todo).  

Generate the network automatically from a directory of images with make_similarity.py.  The resulting network file is read by D3 in js/gallery.js and displayed nicely in the browser whether the photos are portrait or landscape.  

TODO: add more interactivity and more browsing along the various dimensions.
